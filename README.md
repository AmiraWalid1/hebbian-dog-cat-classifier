# Hebbian Dog-Cat Classifier

## Description

This repository contains a classification project that uses Hebbian learning to distinguish between images of dogs and cats. The project utilizes the principles of Hebbian learning, a type of associative learning, to train a neural network. The trained model is then used to classify input images as either 'dog' or 'cat'. This project demonstrates the application of Hebbian learning in image classification tasks.
